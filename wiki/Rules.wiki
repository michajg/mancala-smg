#summary The Rules of the Mancala game

= Rules =

The object of this game is to collect as many seeds in your treasure chest (the rightmost pit) as possible. You and your opponent will take turns to move the seeds according to the following rules:  <br />
1) You can only move the seeds on your side

2) Each time you move, you pick up all the seeds in a cup and distribute them in a counter clockwise direction to the next pit. The treasure chest of the opposing player is left out in this distribution.

3) If the last seed of a move landed on your treasure chest, then you can move again

4) If the last seed of a move landed on an empty pit on your side and there are some seeds in the opposite pit, then the seeds in the two cups will be captured in your treasure chest

5) The game ends when all the pits on one players side are empty. All remaining seeds that are still in the pits of the opposing player go into his treasure chest.
